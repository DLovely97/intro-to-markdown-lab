The CSS selector represents a particular pattern of element or elements in a tree structure. The term *"selector"* can refer to a **simple selector**, a **compound selector**, or a **complex selector**. When included in the :has() pseudo-class as a parameter, these selectors are referred to as relative selectors, representing elements relative to one or more anchor elements.

## 1. Simple Selector

A ***simple selector*** is a selector with a single component, such as a single type selector, attribute selector, or pseudo-class, that's not used in combination with or contains any other selector component or combinator.
```
CSS
#myId {
}

[pattern*="\d"] {
}
```

## 2. Compound Selector

A ***compound selector*** is a sequence of *simple selectors* that are not separated by a combinator. A compound selector represents a set of simultaneous conditions on a single element. A given element is said to match a compound selector when the element matches all the simple selectors in the compound selector.
```
CSS
a#selected {
}

[type="checkbox"]:checked:focus {
}
```
In a compound selector, universal selector must come first in the sequence of selectors and only one universal selector is allowed in the sequence.

## 3. Complex Selector

A ***complex selector*** is a sequence of one or more simple and/or compound selectors that are separated by combinators. A complaex selector represents a set of simulaneous conditions on a set of elements.
```
CSS
a#selected > .icon {
}

.box h2 + p {
}
```
>Tip: Selectors can be read from right to left. For example, ```a#selected > .icon``` matches all elements with a class of ```icon``` that are the direct children of the ```<a>``` element with the id ```selected```. The selector ```.box h2 + p``` matches the first ```<p>```s to come immediately after any ```<h2>``` elements that are descendants of any element with the class of ```box```.
